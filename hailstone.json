		"Huge hailstones of ice plummet to the ground and explode at three different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Constitution saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 4d6} bludgeoning damage and {@damage 4d6} cold damage, and has its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. A creature in the area of more than one hailstone is affected only once. ",
